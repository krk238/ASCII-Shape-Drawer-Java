# ASCII-Shape-Drawer---Java
This is a program that gives you options of drawing ASCII shapes such as a triangle, square or diamond of any dimension with a label of choice embedded in any part of the shape. 
Although this program is conceptually very simple, it helps highlight my ability and the overall benefits to use object - oriented programming with instances of classes, inheritance and recursion. Furthermore, it also designed to be easily modifiable and maintained if future changes or additions are to be made.
