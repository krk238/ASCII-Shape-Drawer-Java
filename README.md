# ASCII-Shape-Drawer---Java
This is a program that gives you options of drawing ASCII shapes such as a triangle, square or diamond of any dimension with a label of choice embedded in any part of the shape. 
Although this program is conceptually very simple, it helps highlight my coding ability and the overall benefits to using object - oriented programming with instances of classes, inheritance and recursion. Furthermore, it also designed to be easily modifiable and maintained if future changes or additions are to be made. 
This code also utilizes input checking by using functions that filter, case correct and check to see if the user input is valid.
This code with full obviousness, can be improved. 
Code files are in the Administrator folder.
